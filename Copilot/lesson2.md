### Exercise 1: Draft cover letters, marketing plans, and outlines with Microsoft 365 Copilot in Word

In this exercise, you'll use Microsoft 365 Copilot in Word to create marketing proposals and other professional documents. You'll practice refining your prompts by including a clear goal, relevant context, supporting source material, and specific expectations—enabling Copilot to produce structured, persuasive, and audience-appropriate drafts with minimal revision.

1. In Word, open the **Contoso CipherGuard Product Specification.docx** document located in the **OneDrive\\CopilotDocs\\M02-Create-draft-content-with-microsoft-copilot-microsoft-365** folder. 

1. Open the **Copilot** pane by selecting the Copilot icon in the ribbon's **Home** tab. Enter the prompts below and follow along.

    Enter the below prompt:

    ```
    Draft a marketing proposal.
    ```

    In this simple prompt, you start with the basic **Goal**: _to create a new marketing proposal._ However, there's no information about what the proposal is funding or who is involved.


    Begin with a basic prompt by stating your goal clearly.
    For example: 

    ```
    Draft a marketing proposal.
    ```

    To make it a good prompt, add context so Copilot understands the purpose and audience of the document.
    You might say: 

    ```
    Create a marketing proposal for Contoso's latest product, CipherGuard. We need to generate three ideas for a marketing campaign.
    ```

    To make the prompt even better, include the source materials or data Copilot should use.
    For example: 

    ```
    Use the product specifications and requirements to support the campaign ideas.
    ```

    For the best prompt, set clear expectations about the structure, content, and tone of the proposal.
    For instance: 

    ```
    Include a brief overview of the product, pros and cons for each idea, and ROI projection. Keep it to two pages and use optimistic, persuasive language.
    ```

    Enter the below crafted prompt:

    ```
    Draft a marketing proposal for Contoso's latest product: CipherGuard. We need to generate three ideas for a marketing campaign using the product specifications and requirements. Please include a brief overview of the product, pros and cons for each idea, and ROI projection. Please keep the document to two pages and use optimistic and convincing language.
    ```

    Review the results of your prompt and follow up with any questions or refinements, then add it to the end of the document in a new section. **Save** the file so it can be used later.

    This prompt gives Copilot everything it needs to come up with a good answer, including the **Goal**, **Context**, **Source**, and **Expectations**.

    Start with a basic prompt by stating your goal clearly.
    For example: 

    ```

    ```

    To make it a good prompt, add some context to help Copilot understand the purpose of the presentation.
    You could say: 

    ```
    We need to present the product's features and benefits to potential clients.
    ```

    To improve the prompt further, specify the source material Copilot should use.
    For instance: 

    ```
    Use the latest information from the file /Market Trend Report - Protein shake.docx.
    ```

    Finally, to make it the best prompt, set clear expectations for what the presentation should include and how it should be written.
    You might say: 

    ```
    Please include an overview of the product, its key features and benefits, and a comparison to similar products in the market. Use simple, client-friendly language.
    ```

    Enter the below crafted prompt:

    ```

    You could say: 

    ```
    Write an email to my client, Allan Deyoung, regarding the status of their support ticket.
    ```

    For instance: 

    ```
    Refer to the latest update from my notes: The issue has been escalated to Tier 2 support, and a resolution is expected within 48 hours.
    ```

    To create the best prompt, clearly set your expectations for tone and formatting.
