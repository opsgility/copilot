# Course Title: MS-4005: Craft effective prompts for Microsoft 365 Copilot

## Lesson 4: Asking, analyzing and querying data with Microsoft Copilot

In this lesson, you learn how to craft effective, contextual prompts for Microsoft 365 Copilot to **ask** for information within Microsoft documents and files. If you're looking to enhance your prompting skills for Copilot, this module equips you with the knowledge and techniques to craft prompts that yield accurate and helpful results from Microsoft 365 Copilot.

The focus of this module is **asking**, **analyzing**, and **querying** information using Microsoft 365 Copilot in different Microsoft 365 apps such as **Word**, **PowerPoint**, **Teams**, **Outlook**, and others. You learn how to use these basic creation capabilities, but also how to craft an efficient prompt that contains all the elements to generate the desired results.


## Lab 

By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:

1. Identify the key elements of an effective prompt and apply them to your own prompts.

1. Ask Copilot how to accomplish a task in Microsoft 365 apps.

1. Use Copilot to answer questions and provide insights about documents, presentations, tables, and notes.

1. Use Microsoft 365 Copilot to ask about projects, documents, and data throughout your organization.

## Ask questions about this document

- Summarize this document - Need to get to the essence of the document quickly? Type Summarize this document into the Copilot chat pane to get a bulleted summary of the document.

- Is there a call to action? - Wondering if the document contains a meaningful call to action? Ask Copilot, and it will attempt to tell you.

## Ask open-ended questions

Want to add some content or context to your document? Ask Copilot general questions, and it will try to give you answers. For example:

- How can I edit this document to make it sound more academic?

- Is there a quote by a United States President about courage?

If those answers aren't in the document, Copilot generates content using the underlying large language models. If you find something you like and want to add it to the document, just copy and paste from the Copilot pane to the document.

## Let's get crafting

In Word, open the **Market Analysis Report for Mystic Spice Premium Chai Tea.docx** document within the **OneDrive\\CopilotDocs\\M04-Ask-analyze-content-with-microsoft-copilot-microsoft-365** folder. Open the **Copilot** pane by selecting the Copilot icon in the ribbon's **Home** tab. Enter the prompts below and follow along.

Enter the below prompt: 

```
Is there a call to action?
```

In this simple prompt, you start with the basic **Goal**: _to find a meaningful call to action in the document._ However, you still haven't explained _why_ you need this information.

| Element | Example |
| :------ | :------- |
| **Basic prompt:** Start with a **Goal** | **_Is there a call to action?_** |
| **Good prompt:** Specify **Source(s)** | Adding **Sources** can help Copilot where to look for specific information. _"...in this market analysis report..."_ |
| **Better prompt:** Add **Context** | Adding **Context** can help Copilot respond with context and give you a more tailored response. _"...to address our challenges and concerns. Please check if the marketing plan includes a clear and specific plan of action, such as a promotional plan or a limited time discount."_ |
| **Best prompt:** Set clear **Expectations** | Lastly, adding **Expectations** can help Copilot understand what exactly you need, instead of just giving you a flat _yes_ or _no_ answer. _"Please provide suggestions for improving the call to action if necessary."_ |

Enter the below crafted prompt:

```
Is there a call to action in this market analysis report to address our challenges and concerns? Please check if the marketing plan includes a clear and specific plan of action, such as a promotional plan or a limited time discount. Please provide suggestions for improving the call to action if necessary.
```

# Ask about your meetings and messages with Microsoft 365 Copilot in Teams

Copilot in Teams meetings and calls helps you capture action items, different perspectives by topic, or unresolved questions. You can even ask Copilot to give you a response as a table, generating a markdown table that's ready for you to copy and share.

Copilot in Teams uses your Teams chat and meeting content to generate insights and actionable suggestions alongside your most important Teams touch points. Copilot in Teams is contextual to whatever it is that you're doing. For example, you can access the Copilot pane in a chat, meeting, or call, as long as a few conditions are met:

- Transcription or recording is turned on. The meeting organizer can configure the meeting so Copilot works without transcription prior to the meeting.

- The meeting or call is long enough for Copilot to analyze. If there isn’t enough transcribed speech in the meeting yet, Copilot states that it needs more information before responding to prompts.

## Access Copilot during a meeting

1. During a meeting or call, select **Copilot** from the meeting controls. If transcription isn’t already turned on, you'll be asked to turn it on.
