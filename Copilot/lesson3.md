### Exercise 1: Write, organize, and transform content using Microsoft 365 Copilot in Word

In this exercise, you'll use Microsoft 365 Copilot in Word to transform plain text into a structured table that clearly communicates employee benefits. You'll learn to write prompts that specify your transformation goal, document source, and formatting expectations—enabling Copilot to reorganize content in a clear, reader-friendly way.

Microsoft 365 Copilot in Word allows you to stay in the flow of ideas while drafting new content and transform your content once you have your ideas written. Copilot can rewrite your text, including adjustments for tone. Copilot can also transform your text into an editable table. Follow the steps to transform your content in Word:


1. In Word, open the **Graphic Design Institute - Employee Benefits.docx** document located in the **OneDrive\\CopilotDocs\\M03-Edit-transform-content-with-microsoft-copilot-microsoft-365** folder. 

1. Highlight all the text in the document (press **Ctrl-A**). Scroll down and click the Copilot menu on the left margin. Select **Visualize as a table**. 


1. After generating the table, follow up with Copilot using the prompts below to refine your results.

 
    Enter the below prompt:

    ```
    Visualize as a table.
    ```

    In this simple prompt, you start with the basic **Goal**: _to transform text into a table._ However, there's no indication what information you want in the table or why it should be a table.

    ![Screenshot the Copilot in Word working on transforming text to table.](media/edit_copilot-visualize-table-word-example.png)

    Begin with a basic prompt by stating your goal clearly.
    For example: 

    ```
    Visualize this information as a table.
    ```

    To make it a good prompt, add context to help Copilot understand what kind of data it's working with and the purpose behind it.
    You might say: 

    ```
    We need a clear way to communicate these benefits to potential employees.
    ```

    To improve the prompt further, identify the source Copilot should use to build the table.
    For instance: 

    ```
    Use the full content of the document titled Graphic Design Institute - Employee Benefits.docx.
    ```

    Finally, to create the best prompt, provide expectations for how the table should be organized and what it should include.
    You could say: 

    ```
    Include a third column that explains each benefit in simple terms and describes how it supports employee wellbeing.
    ```

    Enter the below crafted prompt:

    ```
    Visualize as a table. We need a clear way to communicate these benefits to potential employees. Include a third column that clearly describes the benefit to the employee and how it impacts their wellbeing.
    ```

    This prompt gives Copilot everything it needs to come up with a good answer, including the **Goal**, **Context**, **Source**, and **Expectations**.

### Exercise 2: Add images, slides, and organize your presentation using Microsoft 365 Copilot in PowerPoint

In this exercise, you'll use Microsoft 365 Copilot in PowerPoint to expand and organize a slide deck with relevant visual content. You'll practice refining prompts that define the slide’s purpose, pull insights from source slides, and format the output using concise, audience-focused design principles.


1.. In PowerPoint, open the **Mystic Spice Premium Chai Market Analysis Presentation.pptx** presentation located in the **OneDrive\\CopilotDocs\\M03-Edit-transform-content-with-microsoft-copilot-microsoft-365** folder.

    Enter the below prompt:

    ```
    Add new slides to this PowerPoint presentation.
    ```

    In this simple prompt, you start with the basic **Goal**: _to add new slides to a presentation_. However, there's no indication how many slides you want to add or even what topic they should cover.


    Start with a basic prompt by clearly stating your goal.
    For example: 

    ```
    Add a new slide to the PowerPoint presentation.
    ```

    To make it a good prompt, include context that helps Copilot understand the purpose of the slide and the content it should focus on.
    You might say: 

    ```
    Add a slide summarizing the latest market trends for premium chai, including key consumer preferences and emerging competitors.
    ```

    To strengthen the prompt, point Copilot to a specific source for information.
    For instance: 

    ```
    Use insights from the existing slides on market trends and demand.
    ```

    To create the best prompt, set clear expectations for how the slide should be formatted and written.
    You could say: 

    ```
    Format the slide with engaging visuals and use concise bullet points to highlight key takeaways.
    ```

    Enter the below crafted prompt:

    ```
    Add a new slide to the PowerPoint presentation summarizing the latest market trends for premium chai, including key consumer preferences and emerging competitors. Use insights from the existing slides on market trends and demand. Format the slide with engaging visuals and concise bullet points for key takeaways.
    ```

    With the **Goal**, **Context**, **Source**, and **Expectations** all laid out, Copilot has all it needs to give you a great response.


### Exercise 3: Format, sort, filter, and highlight data using Microsoft 365 Copilot in Excel

In this exercise, you'll use Microsoft 365 Copilot in Excel to sort and highlight key performance data from a campaign spreadsheet. You'll learn to build prompts that combine goals, context, source tables, and formatting expectations—guiding Copilot to execute multi-step actions like filtering and spotlighting top performers.

1. In Excel, open the **Fabrikam Q1 marketing campaigns.xlsx** spreadsheet located in the **OneDrive\\CopilotDocs\\M03-Edit-transform-content-with-microsoft-copilot-microsoft-365** folder. 

1. Open the **Copilot** pane by selecting the Copilot icon in the ribbon's **Home** tab. Enter the prompts below and follow along.

    In this simple prompt, you start with the basic **Goal**: _to sort and filter an Excel table_. However, there's no indication how you want the data sorted and which field you want to filter.

    Start with a basic prompt by stating your goal clearly.
    For example: 

    ```
    Sort this table.
    ```

    To make it a good prompt, add context so Copilot understands the purpose of the sorting.
    You might say: 

    ```
    Sort this table to identify the most impactful salesperson.
    ```

    To improve the prompt further, specify the source or reference point for the data.
    For instance: 

    ```
    Use the data in Table1 from the current Excel worksheet.
    ```

    To make it the best prompt, include expectations about how the table should be organized and what the output should highlight.
    You could say: 

    ```
    Sort the data by net revenue, and highlight both the top and bottom campaign owners based on their performance.
    ```

    Enter the below crafted prompt: 

    ```
    Sort this table [Table1] to look for the most impactful salesperson and highlight the top and bottom campaign owners based off of net revenue.
    ```

    This prompt requires multiple steps to execute, a prompting technique called **chaining** where you ask Copilot to perform sequential, back-to-back commands to achieve a single goal.

    **First prompt**: Sort this table [Table1] to look for the most impactful salesperson.

    **Second Prompt**: highlight the top and bottom campaign owners based off of net revenue

    Copilot has all the info it needs to give you a solid answer, thanks to the **Goal**, **Context**, **Source**, and **Expectations** in this prompt.
