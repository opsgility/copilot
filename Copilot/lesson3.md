# Write, organize, and transform content using Microsoft 365 Copilot in Word

Microsoft 365 Copilot in Word allows you to stay in the flow of ideas while drafting new content and transform your content once you have your ideas written. Copilot can rewrite your text, including adjustments for tone. Copilot can also transform your text into an editable table. Follow the steps to transform your content in Word:

## Rewrite for tone

1. Select the text you want Copilot to rewrite.

1. In the left margin next to your text, select the **Copilot icon**.

1. From the left margin Copilot menu, select **Rewrite**.

1. Copilot shows you rewritten options to choose from.

1. Select **Replace** to use the revised text, **Insert below** to insert the rewritten text below the current text, **Regenerate** to regenerate Copilot's suggestions, or **Adjust tone** to adjust the rewritten text for desired tone.

## Text to table

1. Select the text you want Copilot to turn into a table.

1. In the left margin next to your text, select the **Copilot** icon.

In the following example, we start with a simple prompt to turn some text into a table and add elements along the way. Follow along with the example using your own data.

## Let's get crafting

<!-- First, download **_[Graphic Design Institute - Employee Benefits.docx](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2268825)_** and save the file to your **OneDrive folder** if you haven't yet done so. -->

In Word, open the **Graphic Design Institute - Employee Benefits.docx** document located in the **OneDrive\\CopilotDocs\\M03-Edit-transform-content-with-microsoft-copilot-microsoft-365** folder. 

Highlight all the text in the document (press **Ctrl-A**). Scroll down and click the Copilot menu on the left margin. Select **Visualize as a table**. 

![Visualize as a table](https://labstoragesupport.blob.core.windows.net/lessoncontent/ms-4005-ai-led/media/VisualizeAsTable.png)

After generating the table, follow up with Copilot using the prompts below to refine your results.

![Visualize as a table Continued](https://labstoragesupport.blob.core.windows.net/lessoncontent/ms-4005-ai-led/media/VisualizeAsTable2.png)

Enter the below prompt:

```
Visualize as a table.
```

In this simple prompt, you start with the basic **Goal**: _to transform text into a table._ However, there's no indication what information you want in the table or why it should be a table.

![Screenshot the Copilot in Word working on transforming text to table.](https://labstoragesupport.blob.core.windows.net/lessoncontent/ms-4005-ai-led/media/edit_copilot-visualize-table-word-example.png)

| Element | Example |
| :------ | :------- |
| **Basic prompt:** Start with a **Goal** | **_Visualize as a table._** |
| **Good prompt:** Add **Context** | Adding **Context** can help Copilot understand what kind of data to see and what it will be used for. _"We need a clear way to communicate these benefits to potential employees."_ |
| **Better prompt:** Specify **Source(s)** | The **Source** in this example is the entire text of **Graphic Design Institute - Employee Benefits.docx**. |
| **Best prompt:** Set clear **Expectations** | Lastly, adding **Expectations** can help Copilot understand how you want the table organized and written. _"Include a third column that clearly describes the benefit to the employee and how it impacts their wellbeing."_ |

Enter the below crafted prompt:

```
Visualize as a table. We need a clear way to communicate these benefits to potential employees. Include a third column that clearly describes the benefit to the employee and how it impacts their wellbeing.

# Add images, slides, and organize your presentation using Microsoft 365 Copilot in PowerPoint

Suppose you want to add a slide to a deck on the history of soccer.  Ask Copilot in PowerPoint to “**_Add a slide about the history of Women’s Olympic Soccer_**” and it creates that slide for you.

Copilot can also step in to make what you have even better. Maybe you're teaching a cooking class and need some slides about making pizza, but it could use some images.  Ask Copilot to “**_Add an image of a chef making pizza dough_**” and Copilot will find the perfect image to make your slide more appealing.

Give it a try with the following prompts and see what Copilot can come up with for you.

# Format, sort, filter, and highlight data using Microsoft 365 Copilot in Excel

With Microsoft 365 Copilot in Excel, it's easy to highlight, sort, and filter your tables to quickly call attention to what matters to you. Using a single table in Excel, you can have Copilot effortlessly:

- Sort and filter your data.

- Apply simple conditional formatting.

To get started, format your data in a [supported format](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/format-data-for-copilot-in-excel-1604c8eb-57f1-4db1-8363-d53336228c65) and select the **Copilot** button in the ribbon. Then, tell Copilot how you'd like to manipulate the table to better view portions of your data.

In the following example, we start with a simple prompt and add elements along the way. Follow along with the example using your own data.

## Let's get crafting

<!-- First, download **_[Fabrikam Q1 marketing campaigns.xlsx](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2269124)_** and save the file to your **OneDrive folder** if you haven't yet done so. -->

In Excel, open the **Fabrikam Q1 marketing campaigns.xlsx** spreadsheet located in the **OneDrive\\CopilotDocs\\M03-Edit-transform-content-with-microsoft-copilot-microsoft-365** folder.

Enter the below prompt:

```
Sort this table.
```

| Element | Example |
| :------ | :------- |
| **Basic prompt:** Start with a **Goal** | **_Sort this table..._** |
| **Good prompt:** Add **Context** | Adding **Context** can help Copilot understand what the slides are for and what topic to focus on. _"...to look for the most impactful salesperson."_ |

| **Best prompt:** Set clear **Expectations** | Lastly, adding **Expectations** can help Copilot understand how you want the table sorted, filtered, and presented. _"and highlight the top and bottom campaign owners based off of net revenue."_ |

Enter the below crafted prompt: 

```
Sort this table [Table1] to look for the most impactful salesperson and highlight the top and bottom campaign owners based off of net revenue.
```

This prompt requires multiple steps to execute, a prompting technique called **chaining** where you ask Copilot to perform sequential, back-to-back commands to achieve a single goal.

**First prompt**: Sort this table [Table1] to look for the most impactful salesperson.

**Second Prompt**: highlight the top and bottom campaign owners based off of net revenue
