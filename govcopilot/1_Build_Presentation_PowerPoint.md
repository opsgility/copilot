# FCC Office of Economics and Analytics - Lab 1
## Build Economic Analysis Presentation with Copilot in PowerPoint

### Scenario
Imagine you're an economist at the FCC's Office of Economics and Analytics. Your team is preparing for a Commission meeting where you need to present the economic impact analysis of the proposed 6 GHz unlicensed rules. Your goal is to create a compelling presentation that highlights consumer benefits, industry costs, and policy recommendations while ensuring it adheres to FCC's professional standards. You've already developed comprehensive economic models and want to use that content when preparing for your briefing.

By the end of this lab, you'll be able to create a new presentation based on economic analysis documents, insert relevant images, edit technical content for different audiences, and organize your presentation.

### Getting Started

**Required Files:**
- 6 GHz Economic Impact Model Data.docx
- Auction 110 Bidding Data Analysis.docx  
- Broadband Deployment and Market Analysis Data.xlsx
- Commission Briefing Template - OEA Analysis.docx



## Pre Class Setup: You can skip this step if you did it prior to the class start.

#### Uploading Files to OneDrive

These exercises use *sample* Office Documents that must be downloaded first and then uploaded to OneDrive. 

1. Download the following file. After downloading, extract to a folder on your C: drive called OEA-ResourceFiles. 

- [OEA-ResourceFiles](https://opsgilitylabs.blob.core.windows.net/govcopilot/OEA-ResourceFiles.zip)

Follow these steps to upload all files needed to **OneDrive**:

1. Open the **OneDrive** application by entering **OneDrive** in the Windows search bar.
2. If prompted to **Automatically sign in to all desktop apps**, select **Yes, all apps**.
3. Open your OneDrive folder.
4. In a new instance of **File Explorer**, select **This PC** > **Local Disk (C:)** and open the **OEA-ResourceFiles** folder.
5. Select all files within the **OEA-ResourceFiles** folder, then drag and drop them into your OneDrive folder.
6. When the upload is complete, you should see **Uploaded 4 items to My files**.
7. It will take awhile for the files to index. If you are trying to reference a newly uploaded file in Copilot, it may not appear for 10-20 minutes.

## Exercise 1 - Create Commission Briefing Presentation

1. Open PowerPoint and start a new presentation.

2. Select the **Copilot** icon. Enter the following prompt then add a forward slash (/) followed by the name of the file **(6 GHz Economic Impact Model Data.docx)**. If the file doesn't populate, select the plus button then **Attach** and navigate to the document in your OneDrive folder. Press **Enter**.
    
    ```
    Create a Commission briefing presentation about the economic impact of 6 GHz unlicensed rules based on
    ```

3. Copilot displays a presentation outline showing potential slides including economic analysis, consumer benefits, industry costs, and policy recommendations. It then generates actual slides. Review the slides.

4. The presentation provides a solid foundation, but let's enhance it for Commissioner-level delivery.

## Exercise 2 - Create Executive Summary Slide

Since this presentation will be given to busy Commissioners, let's create an executive summary slide that captures the key economic findings upfront.

1. Enter the following in the Copilot pane.

     ```
     Create an executive summary slide highlighting the three most important economic findings from the 6 GHz analysis. Include quantified benefits and costs with clear policy implications. 
     ```

2. Copilot then generates the slide as described in the prompt.

## Exercise 3 - Insert an Image

Let's enhance our presentation with relevant imagery.

1. Navigate to the title slide. 

2. Enter the following prompt in the Copilot pane:

    ```
    Add an image of an economic chart to the current slide. 
    ```

3. You will see the title slide change to include an image of an economic chart. 

## Exercise 4 - Adapt Technical Content for Commissioners

Economic analysis often contains technical language that needs to be adapted for policy makers. Let's refine the content.

1. Navigate to a slide with text.

2. In the Copilot pane, enter:
    
    ```
    Edit this text to make it more conversational.
    ```

3. Review Copilot's suggestions, then replace the slide text with the more accessible version and make necessary adjustments.

## Exercise 5 - Organize Economic Analysis Flow

Economic presentations need logical flow from analysis to recommendations. Use Copilot to ensure clear organization.

1. In the Copilot pane, enter:

    ```
    Organize this presentation to follow economic analysis best practices
    ```

2. Copilot responds with organizational suggestions for each slide. Rearrange slides according to Copilot's recommendations or request additional organizational options.

3. Ensure that your presentation has a logical sequence and smooth transitions between slides.

<!-- ## Exercise 6 - Add Comparative Analysis Slide

Let's enhance the presentation with auction performance data for context.

1. In the Copilot pane, enter:

    ```
    Create a slide comparing 6 GHz economic projections with historical auction performance data, using insights from our Auction 110 analysis.
    ```

2. Reference the auction document by typing: **/Auction 110 Bidding Data Analysis.docx**

3. Review the comparative analysis suggestions and select **Insert** to add this contextual slide. -->

## (Optional) Exercise 6 - Send Draft for OEA Director Review

1. Launch Microsoft Outlook and select **New mail**.

2. Select the **Copilot** then **Draft with copilot**.

3. Enter the following prompt:

    ```
    Draft an email to the OEA Director requesting review of the attached 6 GHz economic impact presentation for the upcoming Commission meeting. Use professional government tone and highlight key analytical findings.
    ```

4. Click **Generate**.

5. Review the email draft, then select **Keep**. You can then attach your presentation, and send to the intended recipient.

You're now ready to deliver a compelling economic analysis presentation that will inform Commission decision-making with rigorous data and clear policy recommendations!
