# FCC Office of Economics and Analytics - Lab 1
## Build Economic Analysis Presentation with Copilot in PowerPoint

### Scenario
Imagine you're an economist at the FCC's Office of Economics and Analytics. Your team is preparing for a Commission meeting where you need to present the economic impact analysis of the proposed 6 GHz unlicensed rules. Your goal is to create a compelling presentation that highlights consumer benefits, industry costs, and policy recommendations while ensuring it adheres to FCC's professional standards. You've already developed comprehensive economic models and want to use that content when preparing for your briefing.

By the end of this lab, you'll be able to create a new presentation based on economic analysis documents, insert relevant charts, edit technical content for Commissioner audiences, organize complex economic data, and prepare briefing materials for Commission review.

### Getting Started

**Required Files:**
- 6 GHz Economic Impact Model Data.docx
- Auction 110 Bidding Data Analysis.docx  
- Broadband Deployment and Market Analysis Data.xlsx
- Commission Briefing Template - OEA Analysis.docx

#### Step 1: Activate Microsoft Office 
1. Click the PowerPoint icon on the Task bar and when prompted login using your FCC credentials.
2. Accept the defaults for all prompts.

#### Step 2: Uploading Files to OneDrive
Follow these steps to upload all files needed to **OneDrive**:

1. Open the **OneDrive** application by entering **OneDrive** in the Windows search bar.

## Exercise 1 - Create Commission Briefing Presentation

1. Open PowerPoint and start a new presentation.

2. Select the **Copilot** icon, then use Copilot to generate a draft presentation using the following prompt:
    
    ```
    Create a Commission briefing presentation about the economic impact of 6 GHz unlicensed rules based on
    ```

3. In the prompt dialog box, enter a forward slash (/) followed by the name of the file **(6 GHz Economic Impact Model Data.docx)**. If the file doesn't populate, select the plus button then **Attach** and navigate to the document in your OneDrive folder.

4. Copilot displays a presentation outline showing potential slides including economic analysis, consumer benefits, industry costs, and policy recommendations. Review the suggested topics and select **Generate slides**.

5. Review the slides and select **Keep it** to continue.

6. The presentation provides a solid foundation, but let's enhance it for Commissioner-level delivery.

## Exercise 2 - Create Executive Summary Slide

Since this presentation will be given to busy Commissioners, let's create an executive summary slide that captures the key economic findings upfront.

1. Change to **View -> Normal** if necessary, then return to **Home** ribbon.

2. Open the Copilot pane and enter:

     ```
     Create an executive summary slide highlighting the three most important economic findings from the 6 GHz analysis. Include quantified benefits and costs with clear policy implications.
     ```

3. Copilot responds with key economic metrics and policy conclusions. Review the suggestions and select the most appropriate option.

4. Enter the following prompt to position this strategically:

    ```
    Insert this executive summary as the second slide in the presentation, right after the title slide.
    ```

## Exercise 3 - Insert Economic Data Visualization

Economic presentations need compelling data visualizations. Let's enhance our presentation with relevant charts and graphics.

1. Navigate to the slide discussing consumer benefits.

2. Enter the following prompt in the Copilot pane:

    ```
    Replace the current image with a chart showing consumer welfare gains over a 10-year period, highlighting the $183 billion in benefits.
    ```

3. Copilot opens the **Designer** feature and creates visualization options that match your economic data.

4. Select **Insert** your preferred chart option.

5. Adjust the chart size and position to best fit the slide layout.

## Exercise 4 - Adapt Technical Content for Commissioners

Economic analysis often contains technical language that needs to be adapted for policy makers. Let's refine the content.

1. Navigate to a slide with technical economic terminology.

2. In the Copilot pane, enter:
    
    ```
    Rewrite this slide content to be accessible to policy makers while maintaining analytical rigor. Focus on policy implications rather than technical methodology.
    ```

3. Copy the existing technical text and paste it into the Copilot prompt dialog, then select **Send**.

4. Review Copilot's suggestions, then replace the slide text with the more accessible version and make necessary adjustments.

## Exercise 5 - Organize Economic Analysis Flow

Economic presentations need logical flow from analysis to recommendations. Use Copilot to ensure clear organization.

1. In the Copilot pane, enter:

    ```
    Organize this presentation to follow economic analysis best practices: problem statement, methodology, findings, costs and benefits, and policy recommendations.
    ```

2. Copilot responds with organizational suggestions for each slide, ensuring logical progression from economic theory to policy application.

3. Rearrange slides according to Copilot's recommendations or request additional organizational options.

4. Ensure smooth transitions between economic concepts and policy implications.

## Exercise 6 - Add Comparative Analysis Slide

Let's enhance the presentation with auction performance data for context.

1. In the Copilot pane, enter:

    ```
    Create a slide comparing 6 GHz economic projections with historical auction performance data, using insights from our Auction 110 analysis.
    ```

2. Reference the auction document by typing: **/Auction 110 Bidding Data Analysis.docx**

3. Review the comparative analysis suggestions and select **Insert** to add this contextual slide.

## (Optional) Exercise 7 - Send Draft for OEA Director Review

1. Launch Microsoft Outlook and select **New mail**.

2. Select the **Copilot** icon in the email composition window.

3. Enter the following prompt:

    ```
    Draft an email to the OEA Director requesting review of the attached 6 GHz economic impact presentation for the upcoming Commission meeting. Use professional government tone and highlight key analytical findings.
    ```

4. Select **Draft with Copilot**.

5. Review the email draft, attach your presentation, and send to the intended recipient.

You're now ready to deliver a compelling economic analysis presentation that will inform Commission decision-making with rigorous data and clear policy recommendations!
