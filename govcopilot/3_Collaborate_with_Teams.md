# FCC Office of Economics and Analytics - Lab 3
## Coordinate Economic Analysis Team Collaboration

### Scenario
Imagine you're the lead economist at the FCC's Office of Economics and Analytics. Your team needs to coordinate analysis of auction performance data and prepare recommendations for upcoming spectrum policy decisions. You need to rally your economics team around new analytical approaches for Auction 110 evaluation and coordinate the integration of market analysis data before the quarterly Commission briefing deadline. Use Copilot to draft, refine, and manage team communications for this critical economic analysis project.

## Exercise 2 - Coordinate Cross-Functional Analysis

Your team responds with enthusiasm and technical suggestions! Now you need to coordinate with other FCC offices for comprehensive analysis.

1. In the same channel, compose a follow-up message about coordination needs:

    ```
    Excellent analytical suggestions from everyone! Now we need to coordinate with the Wireless Bureau for spectrum engineering data and the Enforcement Bureau for compliance patterns. Our economic analysis will be stronger with their technical insights. We should also align our auction assessment with broader market competition analysis.
    ```

2. Use **Rewrite with Copilot** and select **Adjust** then **Custom**. Enter the following to include the tone:

    ```
    collaborative and strategic
    ```

## Exercise 4 - Request Data and Analysis Support

Your team needs additional data support for the comprehensive analysis.

1. Return to Teams and post a new message in your created Team about analytical resources:

    ```
    For our enhanced auction analysis, we'll need access to historical auction databases, international comparison data, and econometric software licenses. Can our research support team help coordinate these resources? We also need the latest broadband deployment data for market context analysis.
    ```

    ```
    systematic and detailed
    ```

3. Select **Replace** and **Post** the resource request.

## Exercise 5 - Share Preliminary Economic Findings

Your team has completed initial analysis and you need to share preliminary results.

1. Create a new post sharing analysis progress:

    ```
    Team update: Our preliminary Auction 110 analysis shows interesting competitive dynamics. Price formation appears efficient overall with HHI indicating moderate concentration. Consumer welfare gains are significant, but we're seeing geographic disparities in investment patterns. The econometric models suggest strategic bidding in major markets. Let's discuss these findings in our review meeting and implications for future auction design.
    ```

2. Use **Rewrite with Copilot** to enhance technical precision.

3. Select **Adjust** > **Custom** and specify:

    ```
    technically precise and policy-focused
    ```

4. Review the enhanced technical summary and post.

## Exercise 6 - Coordinate Final Analysis Integration

As analysis components come together, coordinate final integration.

1. Post a coordination message:

    ```
    Excellent progress on individual analysis components! Now we need to integrate auction performance data with market competition analysis and policy recommendations. Our Commission briefing should present a cohesive economic story from data to recommendations. Let's ensure our methodology is transparent and our policy conclusions are well-supported by quantitative evidence.
    ```

2. Use **Rewrite with Copilot** with **Professional** custom tone adjustment.

3. Review and post the integration guidance.

## Exercise 7 - Schedule Commission Briefing Preparation

Finally, coordinate preparation for the Commission briefing.

1. Return to Outlook and use Copilot to schedule a briefing preparation session:

    ```
    Schedule a Commission briefing preparation meeting to practice our economic analysis presentation, review technical questions, and finalize policy recommendations. Include time for dry run presentation and Q&A preparation.
    ```

2. Use **Draft with Copilot** for the meeting details:
