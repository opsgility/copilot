# FCC Office of Economics and Analytics - Lab 4
## Advanced Economic Data Analysis with Copilot in Excel

### Scenario
Imagine you're a senior economist at the FCC's Office of Economics and Analytics. Your primary responsibility is to analyze complex auction data, assess market competition, and generate economic insights that inform Commission policy decisions. In this hands-on lab, you'll use Copilot in Excel to explore Auction 110 performance data, analyze bidder behavior patterns, and calculate economic efficiency metrics.

You'll start by examining auction participation and revenue data, then analyze competitive dynamics, calculate market concentration measures, and assess geographic distribution of benefits. Additionally, you'll examine correlations between bidder characteristics and auction outcomes, and generate comprehensive economic insights for policy recommendations.

## Exercise 1 - Explore Auction 110 Dataset

First, understand the comprehensive auction dataset to identify key economic metrics and analytical opportunities.

1. Open the sample file **Auction 110 Bidding Data Analysis.xlsx** from your OneDrive.

2. Select the **Copilot** icon on the **Home** ribbon to open the Copilot pane.

3. Enter the following prompt:

    ```
    Analyze this auction dataset and provide an economic overview including total revenue, participation metrics, competitive intensity measures, and key performance indicators relevant for regulatory assessment.
    ```

    Copilot responds with comprehensive economic metrics and analysis that you can add to a new sheet.

4. Select **Add to a new sheet** to include this summary analysis in your workbook.

5. Review the economic overview table. When done, select **Go back to data** to return to Sheet 1.

## Exercise 2 - Analyze Market Concentration

Economic analysis requires assessment of market structure in the auction.

1. Enter the following prompt in the copilot pane.

    ```
    Show a chart of market concentration metrics
    ```

2. Review Copilot's chart of market concentration measure.

3. Select **Add to a new sheet** to include the chart.

4. Return to the main data sheet to continue analysis.

5. To understand geographic competition patterns, enter:

    ```
    Analyze how competitive intensity varies across different Economic Areas, highlighting markets with highest and lowest competition levels.
    ```

    ```
    Highlight the three markets with the highest total competition levels.
    ```

6. If you want, **apply** any conditional formatting rules Copilot suggests to visualize competition patterns.

## Exercise 3 - Examine Bidding Behavior and Price Formation

Understanding bidder behavior provides insights into auction efficiency and strategic considerations.

1. Continue in the Copilot pane.

2. Prompt Copilot with:

    ```
    Create a bar chart comparing total revenue (billions) and number of qualified bidders for each year.
    ```

3. Copilot displays the chart. Select **Add to a new sheet**.

4. Return to the main data to examine strategic behavior patterns.

5. Enter the following prompt to identify potential strategic bidding:

    ```
    Analyze bidder behavior patterns to identify potential demand reduction, jump bidding, or other strategic behaviors that might affect auction efficiency.
    ```

## Exercise 4 - Calculate Economic Efficiency Metrics

Economic efficiency assessment is crucial for evaluating auction design effectiveness.

1. Continue in the Copilot pane.

2. Prompt Copilot with:

    ```
    Calculate economic efficiency metrics including allocative efficiency measures, revenue efficiency compared to theoretical optimum, and price discovery effectiveness indicators and add them as new columns.
    ```

3. Select **Insert columns** to add efficiency calculations to your dataset.

4. Generate additional welfare analysis by entering:

    ```
    Estimate consumer surplus implications based on final auction prices and calculate producer surplus for winning bidders. Include deadweight loss assessment if any.
    ```

## Exercise 5 - Analyze Geographic and Demographic Impact

Economic analysis must consider distributional effects and equity implications.

1. Continue in the Copilot pane.

2. Determine geographic impact patterns by entering:

    ```
    Identify any correlations between total revenue (billions) and rural coverage (percent).
    ```

    Copilot generates geographic analysis showing investment distribution patterns and equity considerations.

3. Select **Add to sheet** to include geographic impact analysis.

<!-- 4. For demographic assessment, enter:

    ```
    Calculate per-capita investment levels across different Economic Areas and correlate with demographic factors like income levels, education, and population density.
    ``` -->

## Exercise 6 - Generate Comparative Economic Analysis

Compare Auction 110 performance with historical auctions for policy insights.

1. In the Copilot pane, enter:

    ```
    Compare Auction 110 economic performance metrics with historical spectrum auctions, including revenue efficiency, competitive participation, and market structure outcomes. Identify trends and policy implications.
    ```

2. Review the comparative analysis results.

3. Generate policy insights by prompting:

    ```
    Based on this comprehensive economic analysis, identify key policy recommendations for future auction design, competition promotion, and regulatory effectiveness improvements.
    ```

## Exercise 7 - Create Economic Impact Summary

Synthesize the analysis into a comprehensive economic assessment for Commission briefing.

1. In the Copilot pane, enter:

    ```
    Generate a comprehensive economic impact summary that quantifies auction benefits, assesses market efficiency, identifies policy implications, and provides recommendations for Commission consideration.
    ```

2. **Copy** the economic impact summary generated by Copilot.

## Exercise 8 - Communicate Economic Findings

Share your economic analysis insights with OEA leadership and Commission staff.

1. Open Microsoft Outlook and select **New email**.

2. Paste the economic analysis summary into the email body.

3. Select the **Copilot** icon in the email window. Select **Draft** if listed.

4. Enter the following prompt:

    ```
    Draft a professional email summarizing key economic findings from Auction 110 analysis, highlighting competitive dynamics, efficiency measures, and policy recommendations for Commission consideration.
    ```

5. Review the draft and select **Keep** to include refined content.

<!-- ## Exercise 9 - Advanced Econometric Analysis

For more sophisticated economic analysis, explore advanced analytical techniques.

1. Return to your Excel workbook and open the Copilot pane.

2. Enter an advanced analysis prompt:

    ```
    Perform regression analysis to identify factors that significantly influence final auction prices. Include bidder characteristics, market demographics, and competitive intensity variables.
    ```

3. Review the econometric results and model interpretation.

4. For policy simulation, enter:

    ```
    Model counterfactual scenarios showing how auction outcomes might differ under alternative reserve price levels or different competitive structures.
    ```

## Exercise 10 - Generate Policy Research Report

Create comprehensive research documentation for institutional knowledge.

1. In the Copilot pane, enter:

    ```
    Create a detailed methodology summary documenting the economic analysis approach, data sources, analytical techniques, key assumptions, and validation procedures used in this auction assessment.
    ```

2. Select **Add to a new sheet** for the methodology documentation.

3. Generate research conclusions:

    ```
    Summarize the most important economic insights from this analysis that should inform future FCC spectrum policy decisions and auction design considerations.
    ``` -->

You now have comprehensive experience using Copilot in Excel for sophisticated economic analysis, from basic data exploration to advanced econometric modeling. These techniques will enhance your ability to provide rigorous economic analysis supporting Commission policy decisions and regulatory effectiveness assessment.
