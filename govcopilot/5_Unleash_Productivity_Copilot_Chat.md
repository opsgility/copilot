    ```
    Add questions about econometric techniques, data validation, sensitivity analysis, and international benchmarking that Commissioners with economics backgrounds might ask.
    ```

3. Include policy implementation questions:

    ```
    Generate questions about economic impact implementation timelines, measurement and monitoring approaches, and policy effectiveness assessment that policy-focused Commissioners might raise.
    ```

## Exercise 4 - Draft Responses to Economic Analysis Questions

Develop clear, compelling answers that communicate complex economic concepts effectively.

1. In Copilot Chat, prompt for response development:

    ```
    Draft detailed but accessible responses to these economic methodology questions that explain consumer welfare analysis, cost-benefit methodology, and economic modeling approaches in terms suitable for Commissioner-level policy discussion.
    ```

2. Focus on specific analytical techniques:

    ```
    Create explanations for key economic concepts in the 6 GHz analysis: willingness to pay estimation, deadweight loss calculation, producer and consumer surplus analysis, and net present value methodology. Make explanations clear but technically accurate.
    ```

3. Address potential concerns:

    ```
    Prepare responses to potential Commissioner concerns about economic analysis limitations, uncertainty quantification, distributional effects, and sensitivity to key assumptions.
    ```

## Exercise 5 - Develop Policy Communication Strategies

Prepare effective ways to communicate economic insights for policy decision-making.

1. In Copilot Chat, enter:

    ```
    Suggest communication strategies for effectively presenting complex economic analysis to policy makers, including techniques for explaining quantitative findings, discussing uncertainty, and connecting analysis to policy recommendations.
    ```

2. Focus on Commission-specific approaches:

    ```
    How should economic analysis be presented to FCC Commissioners to maximize policy relevance? Include suggestions for visual presentation, narrative structure, and emphasis on regulatory implications.
    ```

## Exercise 6 - Create Commissioner Briefing FAQ Document

Compile your preparation materials into a comprehensive reference document.

1. In Copilot Chat, prompt for document creation:

    ```
    Create a comprehensive FAQ document that includes the technical questions about 6 GHz economic analysis and clear, policy-focused responses suitable for Commission briefing preparation.
    ```

    Copilot generates a structured FAQ document with economic analysis questions and responses.

2. Open the generated Word document to review content.

3. Enable editing and enhance the document with additional sections:

    ```
    Add sections covering international comparison data, stakeholder impact analysis, and policy implementation considerations to make this a complete briefing preparation resource.
    ```

4. Save the document to OneDrive as **"6 GHz Economic Analysis - Commission Briefing FAQ"**.

## Exercise 7 - Prepare Economic Data Presentation Points

Develop key talking points that highlight the most important economic findings.

1. Continue in Copilot Chat:

    ```
    Generate key talking points that highlight the most compelling economic findings from 6 GHz analysis: the $127 billion net present value, 3.27:1 benefit-cost ratio, and consumer welfare gains. Frame these for maximum policy impact.
    ```

2. Create context for the numbers:

    ```
    Develop explanations that put the $183 billion in consumer benefits into perspective relative to other FCC policy decisions and telecommunications sector economic impacts.
    ```

3. Address implementation reality:

    ```
    Prepare talking points about economic analysis limitations, implementation challenges, and ongoing monitoring needs that demonstrate analytical sophistication and policy realism.
