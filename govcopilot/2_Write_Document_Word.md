# FCC Office of Economics and Analytics - Lab 2
## Draft Economic Analysis Report with Copilot in Word

### Scenario
Imagine you're a senior economist at the FCC's Office of Economics and Analytics tasked with creating a comprehensive economic impact report for the Commission's consideration of 6 GHz unlicensed rules. In this lab, you'll use Microsoft Word to draft the report, integrate data from multiple economic analyses, and prepare the document for Commission review and stakeholder distribution.

This report will serve as the definitive economic analysis supporting the Commission's regulatory decision-making process.

---

## Exercise 1 - Draft Economic Impact Report

Let's create a comprehensive economic impact report using the analysis you've already completed.

1. Open a new Word document.

2. Select the on-canvas Copilot experience at the top of the blank document.

3. Enter the following prompt then add a forward slash (/) followed by the name of the file **(6 GHz Economic Impact Model Data.docx)**.
    
    ```
    Create a comprehensive economic impact report that includes an executive summary, methodology overview, consumer welfare analysis, industry cost assessment, net benefit calculation, and policy recommendations. Use the linked document as the primary analytical foundation.
    ```

5. Select **Generate**.

6. Review the drafted content and select **Keep it**.

7. The economic methodology section appears quite technical for a broader Commission audience. Let's make it more accessible while maintaining analytical rigor.

8. Highlight the methodology paragraph and select the **Copilot** icon that appears to the left.

9. Select **Auto Rewrite** from the menu and review the options.

10. In the **What do you want Copilot to change?** field, enter:

    ```
    Rewrite this methodology section to explain the economic approach in clear terms suitable for Commissioners and policy staff. Maintain technical accuracy while improving accessibility.
    ```

11. Review the rewritten options and select **Replace** with your preferred version.

## Exercise 2 - Convert Cost-Benefit Analysis to Table

Economic data is often more digestible in tabular format. Let's transform our cost-benefit analysis into a clear comparison table.

1. Ask Copilot to add a detailed cost-benefit breakdown using the on-canvas option:

    ```
    Add a detailed cost-benefit analysis showing consumer benefits, industry costs, and net economic impact over the 10-year analysis period.
    ```

2. Select **Keep it** to add this section to your report.

3. Highlight the cost-benefit section that was generated.

4. Select the on-canvas **Copilot** icon to the left of the text.

5. Select **Visualize as a table** from the menu.

6. The table looks good, but let's enhance it for policy analysis. Type the following in the Copilot dialog:

    ```
    Add columns for "Year 1-3 Impact," "Year 4-7 Impact," and "Year 8-10 Impact" to show how benefits and costs evolve over time.
    ```

7. Select **Keep it** to insert the enhanced table.

8. Review the table format and make any necessary adjustments.

## Exercise 3 - Summarize the document

Let's add a summary to the end of the document.

1. Position your cursor at the bottom of the document. Select the on-canvas **Copilot** icon on the left. Enter the following prompt:

    ```
    Summarize this document. Highlight the top three points made.
    ```

2. Click **Generate** then **Keep it**. 

3. Save your document for future reference. 

<!-- ## Exercise 3 - Integrate Market Analysis Data

Let's enhance our report by incorporating broadband market competition data to provide policy context.

1. Position your cursor where you want to add market analysis context.

2. Open the Copilot pane and enter:

    ```
    Add a market context section that explains current broadband competition levels and how 6 GHz unlicensed access could affect market dynamics. Reference the market analysis data.
    ```

3. Reference the market data file: **/Broadband Deployment and Market Analysis Data.docx**

4. Select **Generate** and review the market context analysis.

5. Select **Insert** to include this analysis in your report.

## Exercise 4 - Create Policy Recommendations Section

Economic analysis should lead to clear policy guidance. Let's develop actionable recommendations.

1. Open the Copilot pane and enter:

    ```
    Generate a policy recommendations section based on the economic analysis. Include specific regulatory approaches, implementation considerations, and risk mitigation strategies.
    ```

2. Review the generated recommendations and select **Insert**.

3. Highlight the recommendations section and use the on-canvas Copilot to refine:

    ```
    Structure these recommendations in order of priority, with specific implementation timelines and success metrics.
    ```

4. Select your preferred organizational approach.

## Exercise 5 - Add International Comparison Analysis

Let's enhance the report with international benchmarking context.

1. In the Copilot pane, enter:

    ```
    Add a section comparing the US 6 GHz approach with international regulatory decisions, highlighting competitive advantages and policy lessons learned.
    ```

2. Review the international comparison content and select **Insert**.

3. Position this section appropriately within your report structure.

## Exercise 6 - Create Executive Summary

As you complete your report, create a compelling executive summary that captures the key economic findings.

1. Navigate to the beginning of your document after the title.

2. Open the Copilot pane and enter:

    ```
    Create an executive summary that highlights the key economic findings: $127 billion net present value, 3.27:1 benefit-cost ratio, and critical policy recommendations. Limit to 250 words for busy policymakers.
    ```

3. Review the generated summary and select **Insert**.

4. Make any necessary formatting adjustments to ensure the executive summary stands out.

## Exercise 7 - Generate Economic Data Appendix

Economic reports need supporting technical detail for review and validation.

1. Move to the end of your document.

2. In the Copilot pane, enter:

    ```
    Create an appendix section that includes key economic assumptions, data sources, sensitivity analysis results, and methodological notes for technical review.
    ```

3. Select **Insert** to add the comprehensive appendix.

4. Format the appendix with clear section headers and ensure it's well-organized for reference.

## Exercise 8 - Prepare Document for Review

Finally, let's ensure the document meets FCC standards and is ready for distribution.

1. In the Copilot pane, enter:

    ```
    Review this document for consistency, professional tone, and completeness. Suggest any improvements needed for Commission-level review.
    ```

2. Review Copilot's suggestions and implement recommended improvements.

3. Save your document with an appropriate filename: "6 GHz Economic Impact Analysis - Final Report"

4. The document is now ready for OEA Director review and subsequent Commission consideration.

Your comprehensive economic impact report provides the analytical foundation needed for informed regulatory decision-making. The clear structure, accessible language, and rigorous analysis will support effective policy development and stakeholder communication. -->
