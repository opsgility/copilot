# Lab 2 – Draft, Improve, and Share Your ALZ-201 Development Strategy with Copilot in Word

Imagine you're a project coordinator in the research division of a pharmaceutical company. You've been asked to prepare a detailed, publication-ready version of the development strategy for ALZ-201—a novel experimental drug candidate aimed at treating Alzheimer's disease. In this lab, you'll use Microsoft Word and Copilot to draft structured content using a source document, revise sections to enhance clarity and tone, and prepare the material for stakeholder collaboration and communication.

This lab highlights how Microsoft Copilot in Word can help you build on existing research assets to create more polished, accessible, and collaborative R&D deliverables. You can complete every step directly within Word using the Copilot canvas and tools.

## Sample File

Throughout this Lab, we'll craft prompts for Microsoft 365 Copilot that reference the file **Comprehensive R&D Roadmap for ALZ-201.docx**. It's a document outlining the rationale, objectives, key research findings, and strategic development plans for a novel Alzheimer's therapy.

## Exercise 1 – Structure and Expand Your R&D Document

1. Create a new Word document.
2. Select the **Copilot** **Draft document based on** option at the top of the page.
3. Reference the document you uploaded to OneDrive by entering `/Comprehensive R&D Roadmap for ALZ-201.docx`.
4. Enter the following prompt:  
   `Use the source file to draft a refined development strategy document. Include an executive summary, development objectives, strategic activities, research highlights, and success metrics. Align content with the original structure.`

5. Select **Generate**.
6. Review the output and click **Keep it**.
7. Highlight a section, such as the executive summary, and select the **Copilot** icon that appears next to the text.
8. Choose **Auto Rewrite** and then:
   - **Replace** the original with the new version
   - **Insert below** to compare both
   - Or **Regenerate** if you want to see new options
9. Use the following prompt to improve tone:  
   `Refine this section for clarity, and ensure it sounds appropriate for both scientific and non-technical stakeholders.`

## Exercise 2 – Create a Clinical Milestones Table

1. Ask Copilot to:  
   `Generate a list of major R&D milestones for ALZ-201 and their projected timeframes over the next 24–36 months.`
2. Click **Keep it** to add the generated list to your document.
3. Highlight the milestone list and activate the Copilot menu.
4. Choose **Visualize as a table**.
5. In the prompt box, enter:  
   `Add another column titled “Status” to reflect current progress or dependencies.`
6. Accept the final version of the table and review the formatting.

## Exercise 3 – Summarize for Stakeholder Communication

1. In the Copilot pane, enter:  
   `Summarize this development strategy for ALZ-201. Emphasize the rationale, goals, and current progress.`
2. Place your cursor where you want the summary to appear and click **Insert**.
3. Highlight the inserted summary and choose **Auto Rewrite** if refinement is needed.
4. Use the polished version to support briefing decks, status reports, or external communications.

## Final Step

Save your document to OneDrive. Share it with colleagues or leadership for review, or reuse it in regulatory briefings, investor updates, or publication drafts.
