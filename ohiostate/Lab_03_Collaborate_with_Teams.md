# Lab 3 - Manage collaboration from start to finish

Imagine you're a research program coordinator overseeing the development of ALZ-201, a novel therapeutic candidate for Alzheimer’s disease. Your multidisciplinary team of scientists, clinical trial managers, and regulatory affairs experts needs an effective way to stay aligned on goals, updates, and key milestones. You want to initiate a collaborative discussion around the trial planning timeline and upcoming IND submission using Microsoft Teams. Then, you'll use Copilot in Outlook to schedule a follow-up meeting. Use Copilot to draft, rewrite, and adjust your messages to ensure they're clear, professional, and action-oriented.

## Exercise 1 - Write an engaging message to introduce your idea

1. Open Microsoft Teams by navigating to the following URL: [teams.microsoft.com](https://teams.microsoft.com) or through the desktop application.
2. To start, create a new Team in your team's chat for this conversation. Select **New Team** from the Chat dropdown menu.
    - Add the Team: *R&D Coordination*
    - Description: leave blank
    - Team Type: **Private**
    - Channel name: *ALZ-201 Development*
    - Add members: select **Skip**
3. Select **Start a post** to open the chat window.
4. Add a subject and write your message in the box at the bottom of the chat or channel. Copy and paste the following text into the dialog box:  
   *Hi Team! As we move forward with the development of ALZ-201, I’d like to start a conversation around our IND submission preparation and clinical trial timeline. Please share any insights or concerns you may have, especially around feasibility, site selection, and any recent findings we should factor into our timeline.*
5. Before you post the message, select the **Rewrite with Copilot** icon at the bottom of the message box.
6. Choose the **Rewrite** option to generate another version of your message that improves its grammar and style. You can rewrite your message up to 10 times, each time generating a new version. Use the left and right arrows below the text to navigate through versions.
7. While this message is adequate, it may benefit from a more collaborative tone or additional clarity.
8. Select **Adjust**, then select from the options Copilot presents to edit and update your message. You can customize the message if it's still not right.
9. Select **Custom** from the **Adjust** option. Try custom tones like *collaborative* or *professional*.
10. Select **Replace** when you're satisfied with the new message. If you selected a partial section, only that text updates.
11. Once you replace the original message, select **Post**.

The team receives your message and begins contributing feedback, raising ideas about the trial readiness plan, and surfacing questions that need resolution.

## Exercise 2 - Schedule a meeting in Outlook

You now want to schedule a meeting to further discuss the feedback gathered in Teams. Use Copilot in Outlook to find an appropriate time based on your calendar and draft a meeting invite to summarize the agenda.

1. Open Microsoft Outlook from your browser ([outlook.office.com](https://outlook.office.com)) or desktop application.
2. Select the **Copilot** icon from the **Home** ribbon to open the Copilot pane.
3. Ask Copilot to suggest the best time for the meeting by entering the following prompt:  
   *Schedule a meeting next week based on my availability.*
4. Review the suggested time.
5. Select **Edit** to add context to the meeting invite.
6. Select the **Draft with Copilot** option and enter the following prompt:  
   *to discuss IND readiness, review preclinical data milestones, and identify clinical trial site candidates.*  
   Once done, select **Generate** or press enter on your keyboard.
7. Copilot will create a draft of the meeting invite. Review the suggestion but don't select **Keep it**. Instead, enter the following prompt:  
   *Rewrite this email in a professional tone.*
8. Review Copilot's suggestion and select to **Keep it**.

By using Copilot in Microsoft Teams and Outlook, you can easily compose messages, refine your tone, and coordinate meetings with precision. This lab demonstrates how you can use these tools to streamline internal communication and maintain momentum across your research and development efforts for ALZ-201.
